286, Oh I know. I know youre not. Cause I asked her. It really took me forever to get in touch with her. She was ducking my calls for weeks. So I finally left a message What exactly is going on between you and my husband? I thought thatd get her attention and it did. So she called me back and she finally told me. The money? For your treatment? Gretchen and Elliott didnt give you a dime. They paid for nothing. You refused every offer they made you but that didnt make sense because I checked with Delcavoli in the hospital and not including your surgery were nearly paid up. Over $100000. Out of where? Out of thin air? But then I called your mother. Yeah. Thanks for that too. But I thought yknow maybe she has some money that I dont know about? Maybe she contributed? Its possible. It turns out that not only is the money not your mother she didnt even know that you have cancer. You never went to see her. I dropped you at the airport I picked you up you were gone for four days and yet she swears that you were never there. Lies on top of lies on top of lies.,Skyler,3

337, Ooooh wire.,Jesse,2
338, No I am just trying to understand how this works!,Walter,2
339, [to Skyler] Our son doesnt know who Boz Scaggs is. We have failed as parents.,Walter,5
340, I have spent my whole life scared – frightened of things that could happen might happen might not happen. Fifty years I spent like that. Finding myself awake at three in the morning. But you know what? Ever since my diagnosis I sleep just fine.,Walter,5
341, [pointing to Walters chemo mark on his chest] My aunt had one of those...dots on her to target the radiation. What is it in your lung? Im your partner man. You should have told me. Thats not cool okay? Not at all. What stage are you?,Jesse,1

Home equity line $30000 thats $137000. Cost of living food clothing utilities – say two grand a month? I mean that should put a dent in it anyway. 24K a year provides for say ten years. Thats $240000 plus 360 plus 137...737. $737000 thats what I need. That is what I need. You and I both clear about 70 grand a week. Thats only ten and a half more weeks. Call it eleven. Eleven more drug deals and always in a public place from now on. Its doable. Definitely doable.,Walter,4
356, Marijuana yeah. Not a lot. I mean I dont know. I kind of like it.,Walter,1

387, Nice job wearing the pants.,Walter,3
388, What would you know about me Gretchen? What would your presumption about me be exactly? That I should go begging for your charity and you waving your checkbook around like some magic wand is going to make me forget how you and Elliott – how you and Elliott – cut me out?,Walter,3

405, What is that? Conjecture? Are you basing that on that hes got a normal healthy brain or something? Did you not see him beat a dude to death for like nothing?

468, Okay can you at least tell me why?,Walter,4
469, In World War II the Germans had an artillery piece – its the biggest in the world – called the Gustav Gun and it weighed a thousand tons. And the Gustav was capable of firing a seven-ton shell and hitting a target – accurately – twenty-three miles away. [chuckles] I mean you could drop bombs on it every day for a month without ever disabling it. But drop a commando – one man – with just a bag of this... and he could melt right through four inches of solid steel and destroy that gun forever.,Walter,1
470, All right all right...,Jesse,5
471, How much?,Jesse,2

480, You need to cut out all your loser crybaby crap right now and think of something scientific!,Jesse,2
481, The blow fish puffs up okay? The blow fish puffs himself up four five times larger than normal but why? Why does he do that? Because it makes him intimidating thats why. Intimidating so that the other scarier fish are scared off and thats you. You are a blow fish. Dont you see? Its just all–all an illusion. Its nothing but air. Now who messes with the blow fish Jesse?,Walter,2
482, Badgers cousin took it to his garage. Its safe.,Jesse,3

So I finally left a message What exactly is going on between you and my husband? I thought thatd get her attention and it did. So she called me back and she finally told me. The money? For your treatment? Gretchen and Elliott didnt give you a dime. They paid for nothing. You refused every offer they made you but that didnt make sense because I checked with Delcavoli in the hospital and not including your surgery were nearly paid up. Over $100000. Out of where? Out of thin air? But then I called your mother. Yeah. Thanks for that too. But I thought yknow maybe she has some money that I dont know about? Maybe she contributed? Its possible. It turns out that not only is the money not your mother she didnt even know that you have cancer. You never went to see her. I dropped you at the airport I picked you up you were gone for four days and yet she swears that you were never there. Lies on top of lies on top of lies.,Skyler,4

852, Oh I know. I know youre not. Cause I asked her. It really took me forever to get in touch with her. She was ducking my calls for weeks. So I finally left a message What exactly is going on between you and my husband? I thought thatd get her attention and it did. So she called me back and she finally told me. The money? For your treatment? Gretchen and Elliott didnt give you a dime. They paid for nothing. You refused every offer they made you but that didnt make sense because I checked with Delcavoli in the hospital and not including your surgery were nearly paid up. Over $100000. Out of where? Out of thin air? But then I called your mother. Yeah. Thanks for that too. But I thought yknow maybe she has some money that I dont know about? Maybe she contributed? Its possible. It turns out that not only is the money not your mother she didnt even know that you have cancer. You never went to see her.
